								<h2>How Anti-Virus Works</h2>
							</header>
							<strong><p>Antivirus software, sometimes known as anti-malware software, is designed to detect, prevent and take action to disarm or remove malicious software from your computer such as viruses, worms and Trojan horses. It may also prevent or remove unwanted spyware and adware in addition to other types of malicious programs. The first versions of antivirus software can be traced as far back as the 1980s.
Antivirus software will begin by checking your computer programs and comparing them to known types of malware. It will also scan your computer for behaviors that may signal the presence of a new, unknown malware. Typically, antivirus software uses all three scanning detection processes:<br>
Specific Detection – This works by looking for known malware by a specific set of characteristics.<br>
Generic Detection – This process looks for malware that are variants of known “families,” or malware related by a common codebase.<br>
Heuristic Detection – This process scans for previously unknown viruses by looking for known suspicious behavior or file structures.<br>
Although the detection tools are highly effective, no antivirus software is failsafe. If you suspect your device has been infected, you should take action to remedy the problem quickly.</p>
