								<h2>3. Browser Hijacker</h2>
							</header>
							<strong><p>A browser hijacker is defined as a “form of unwanted software that modifies a web browser’s settings without the user’s permission.” The result is the placement of unwanted advertising into the browser, and possibly the replacement of an existing home page or search page with the hijacker page. The idea is to make users visit certain websites whether they want to or not so the hijacker enjoys higher advertising revenue. Browser hijackers may also contain spyware to obtain banking information and other sensitive data.

As frustrating as browser hijackers can be, they luckily aren’t terribly challenging to remove—most of the time. Utilizing various software packages is therefore essential to keep hijackers away.</p>
