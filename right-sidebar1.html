								<h2>What Exactly Is Anti-Virus?</h2>
								<span class="byline">Detection And Defence Against Virus</span>
							</header>
							<p><b>There are a variety of defenses against viruses, and ways of detecting their presence. A natural first question is: "Is it possible to detect all viruses?"-Unfortunately not. When referring to an antivirus or anti-virus (virus protection), the "anti" is a prefix that describes the program helps protect against computer viruses.<p>Anti-virus software is a program or set of programs that are designed to prevent, search for, detect, and remove software viruses, and other malicious software like worms, trojans, adware, and more.

These tools are critical for users to have installed and up-to-date because a computer without anti-virus software installed will be infected within minutes of connecting to the internet. The bombardment is constant, with anti-virus companies update their detection tools constantly to deal with the more than 60,000 new pieces of malware created daily.

There are several different companies that build and offer anti-virus software and what each offers can vary but all perform some basic functions:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin:1px;">
<li>Scan specific files or directories for any malware or known malicious patterns</li>
<li>Allow you to schedule scans to automatically run for you</li>
<li>Allow you to initiate a scan of a specific file or of your computer, or of a CD or flash drive at any time.</li>
<li>Remove any malicious code detected –sometimes you will be notified of an infection and asked if you want to clean the file, other programs will automatically do this behind the scenes.</l>
<li>Show you the ‘health’ of your computer</li>
Always be sure you have the best, up-to-date security software installed to protect your computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.</p>
</ul><p>
Typically, antivirus software uses all three scanning detection processes:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin:1px;">
<li><u>Specific Detection</u> – This works by looking for known malware by a specific set of characteristics.</li>
<li><u>Generic Detection</u> – This process looks for malware that are variants of known “families,” or malware related by a common codebase.</li>
<li><u>Heuristic Detection</u> – This process scans for previously unknown viruses by looking for known suspicious behavior or file structures.</li></p>

</ul>

							<h2>Signature-based Detection</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Signature-based detection - This is most common in Traditional antivirus software that checks all the .EXE files and validates it with the known list of viruses and other types of malware. or it checks if the unknown executable files shows any misbehaviour as a sign of unknown viruses.
					Files, programs and applications are basically scanned when they in use. Once an executable file is downloaded. It is scanned for any malware instantly. Antivirus software can also be used without the background on access scanning, but it is always advisable to use on access scanning because it is complex to remove malware once it infects your system</p>

							<h2>Heuristic-based detection</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Heuristic-based detection - This type of detection is most commonly used in combination with signature-based detection. Heuristic technology is deployed in most of the antivirus programs. This helps the antivirus software to detect new or a variant or an altered version of malware, even in the absence of the latest virus definitions.
Antivirus programs use heuristics, by running susceptible programs or applications with suspicious code on it, within a runtime virtual environment. This keeps the vulnerable code from infecting the real world environment.</p>

							<h2>Behaviour-based detection</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Behavioural-based detection - This type of detection is used in Intrusion Detection mechanism. This concentrates more in detecting the characteristics of the malware during execution. This mechanism detects malware only while the malware performs malware actions.</p>

							<h2>Sandbox detection</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Sandbox detection - It functions most likely to that of behavioral based detection method. It executes any applications in the virtual environment to track what kind of actions it performs. Verifying the actions of the program that are logged in, the antivirus software can identify if the program is malicious or not.</p>
