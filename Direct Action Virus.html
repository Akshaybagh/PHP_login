								<h2>5. Direct Action Virus</h2>
							</header>
							<strong><p>A file infector can be either a resident virus or direct action virus.  A resident virus will install itself and hide somewhere in the memory of your computer.  Upon execution, it seeks out other files or programs to infect.  The direct action virus is considered to be "non-resident" and functions by selecting one or more files to infect each time the code is executed. </p>

							<p>The primary intentions of a direct action virus is replication and to spread infection whenever the code is executed.  When certain conditions have been met, the virus is set into action and begins to infect files in the directory or folder it's located in.  It also infects those in directories attached with the AUTOEXEC.BAT file path.   This extension represents a batch file which is always found in the root directory of your hard drive, responsible for performing certain operations when the computer is booted up.      </p>

							<p>One of the earliest detections of a direct action virus was the Rugrat, more commonly known as Win64.Rugrat.  This virus was said to the first infection written in the Intel Itanium instruction set.  This limited the infection to only run on Itanium-based computers as it was only capable of infecting Itanium executable files.  Upon execution, the virus attempted to infect all 64-bit executables in the directory from which it launched and any subdirectories. </p>
