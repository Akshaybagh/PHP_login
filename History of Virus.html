								<h2>History Of Virus</h2>
							</header>
							<strong><p>The first academic work on the theory of self-replicating computer programs[18] was done in 1949 by John von Neumann who gave lectures at the University of Illinois about the "Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata". The work of von Neumann was later published as the "Theory of self-reproducing automata". In his essay von Neumann described how a computer program could be designed to reproduce itself.[19] Von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical "father" of computer virology.[20] In 1972, Veith Risak, directly building on von Neumann's work on self-replication, published his article "Selbstreproduzierende Automaten mit minimaler Informationsübertragung" (Self-reproducing automata with minimal information exchange).[21] The article describes a fully functional virus written in assembler programming language for a SIEMENS 4004/35 computer system. In 1980 Jürgen Kraus wrote his diplom thesis "Selbstreproduktion bei Programmen" (Self-reproduction of programs) at the University of Dortmund.[22] In his work Kraus postulated that computer programs can behave in a way similar to biological viruses.</p>

							<p>The Creeper virus was first detected on ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet, in the early 1970s.[23] Creeper was an experimental self-replicating program written by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies in 1971.[24] Creeper used the ARPANET to infect DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system.[25] Creeper gained access via the ARPANET and copied itself to the remote system where the message, "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" was displayed. The Reaper program was created to delete Creeper.[26] In fiction, the 1973 Michael Crichton sci-fi movie Westworld made an early mention of the concept of a computer virus, being a central plot theme that causes androids to run amok.[27] Alan Oppenheimer's character summarizes the problem by stating that "...there's a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy to an infectious disease process, spreading from one...area to the next." To which the replies are stated: "Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease" and, "I must confess I find it difficult to believe in a disease of machinery."[28] (Crichton's earlier work, the 1969 novel The Andromeda Strain and 1971 film version of it were about a biological virus-like disease that threatened the human race.)</p>
